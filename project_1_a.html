    <p>Hey y'all, once again my name is Amanda. I am a 2015 LIM College graduate with a Bachelor's in Business. I am currently enrolled at a class at New York Code and Design Academy called Web Development 100. In addition to this, I work full-time as a manager.
    </p>
    <p>I am taking this course because I have always had a creative side, and I would like to create/design webpages for companies.
